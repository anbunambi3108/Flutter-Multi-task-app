          " Overview ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, "
          "a condition with symptoms such as inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. "
          "The symptoms differ from person to person."
          " ADHD was formerly called ADD, "
          "or attention deficit disorder. Both children and adults can have ADHD, but the symptoms always begin in childhood. "
          "Adults with ADHD may have trouble managing time, being organized, setting goals, and holding down a job."
          "There are three types of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive."
          "Many reports estimate that anywhere from 5% to 8% of school-age kids have the disorder. But the CDC now puts it at 11%."
          "Some doctors might give children an ADHD label even when they may have another educational, behavioral, or mental issue."
          "The flip side is that some kids who truly have the disorder aren't getting diagnosed with it.  About 4% of adults also have the disorder."
          "To officially meet the criteria for ADHD as an adult, your symptoms must have started by age 12, even if you were never properly diagnosed in childhood. "
          "TREATMENTS:"
          "Types of treatment for ADHD include"
          "Behavior therapy, including training for parents; and Medications."
          "Children with ADHD often show behaviors that can be very disruptive to others."
          "Behavior therapy is a treatment option that can help reduce these behaviors; "
          "it is often helpful to start behavior therapy as soon as a diagnosis is made. "
          "The goals of behavior therapy are to learn or strengthen positive behaviors and eliminate unwanted or problem behaviors."
          "Age group less than 6 yrs"
          "For young children with ADHD, behavior therapy is an important first step before trying medication because:"
          "Parent training in behavior management gives parents the skills and strategies to help their child."
          "Parent training in behavior management has been shown to work as well as medication for ADHD in young children."
          "Young children have more side effects from ADHD medications than older children."
          "The long-term effects of ADHD medications on young children have not been well-studied."
          "School-age children and adolescents"
          "For children ages 6 years and older, AAP recommends combining medication treatment with behavior therapy. "
          "Several types of behavior therapies are effective, including:"
          "Parent training in behavior management;"
          "Behavioral interventions in the classroom;"
          "Peer interventions that focus on behavior; and"
          "Organizational skills training."
          "ADHD in Adults"
          "ADHD lasts into adulthood for at least one-third of children with ADHD. Treatments for adults can include medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments."
          "MEDICATIONS: Medication can help children manage their ADHD symptoms in their everyday life and can help them control the behaviors that cause difficulties with family, friends, and at school. "
          "Stimulants are the best-known and most widely used ADHD medications. Between 70-80% of children with ADHD have fewer ADHD symptoms when taking these fast-acting medications."
          "Nonstimulants were approved for the treatment of ADHD in 2003. They do not work as quickly as stimulants, but their effect can last up to 24 hours."
          "TIPS: 1.Create a routine- Try to follow the same schedule every day, from wake-up time to bedtime."
          "2.Limit choices. To help your child not feel overwhelmed or overstimulated, offer choices with only a few options. "
          "For example, have them choose between this outfit or that one, this meal or that one, or this toy or that one."
          "3.Create positive opportunities. Children with ADHD may find certain situations stressful. Finding out and encouraging what your child does well—whether it’s school, sports, art, music, or play—can help create positive experiences.",

      description: "HOW TO PREVENT FOOD POISONING:"
          "Foodborne illness also called food poisoning is common, costly and preventable. You can get food poisoning after swallowing food that has been contaminated with a variety of germs or toxic substances."
          "the most effective ways to help prevent food poisoning:"
          "Following four simple steps at home — "
          "Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill — "
          "can help protect you and your loved ones from food poisoning."
          "•	Clean"
          "o	Wash your hands and work surfaces before, during, and after preparing food. "
          "o	Germs that cause food poisoning can survive in many places and spread around your kitchen."
          "o	Wash hands for 20 seconds with soap and water before, during, and after preparing food and before eating."
          "o	Wash your utensils, cutting boards, and countertops with hot, soapy water."
          "o	Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running water."
          "•	Separate"
          "o	Separate raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs from ready-to-eat foods. "
          "o	Use separate cutting boards and keep raw meat away from other foods in your shopping cart , refrigerator."
          "•	Cook"
          "o	Food is safely cooked when the internal temperature gets high enough to kill germs that can make you sick. The only way to tell if food is safely cooked is to use a food thermometer. You can’t tell if food is safely cooked by checking its color and texture."
          "o	Use a food thermometer to ensure foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature. Check this chart for a detailed list of foods and temperatures."
          "•	145°F for whole cuts of beef, pork, veal, and lamb (then allow the meat to rest for 3 minutes before carving or eating)"
          "•	160°F for ground meats, such as beef and pork"
          "•	165°F for all poultry, including ground chicken and turkey"
          "•	165°F for leftovers and casseroles"
          "•	145°F for fresh ham (raw)"
          "•	145°F for fin fish or cook until flesh is opaque"
          "•	Chill"
          "o	Keep your refrigerator at 40°F or below and know when to throw food out."
          "o	Refrigerate perishable food within 2 hours. (If outdoor temperature is above 90°F, refrigerate within 1 hour.)"
          "o	Thaw frozen food safely in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave. Never thaw foods on the counter, because bacteria multiply quickly in the parts of the food that reach room temperature."
          "Five Symptoms of Severe Food Poisoning"
          "Symptoms of food poisoning often include diarrhea, vomiting, upset stomach, or nausea. See your doctor if you have severe symptoms such as:"
          "•	High fever (temperature over 102°F, measured orally)"
          "•	Bloody stools "
          "•	Frequent vomiting that prevents keeping liquids down, which can lead to dehydration"
          "•	Diarrhea that lasts more than three days"
          "•	Dehydration, which causes symptoms such as dry mouth and throat, feeling dizzy when standing up, and little or no urination",

      name: 'Food safety and mistakes',
      // iconImage: 'assets/earth.png',
      description:
          "We all want to keep our families safe and healthy. But sometimes a simple mistake in the way we handle and prepare food can lead to serious sickness. With some germs like Salmonella, just a small amount in undercooked food is enough to cause food poisoning. And just a tiny taste of food with botulism toxin can cause paralysis and even death."
          "You can protect your family by avoiding these common food safety mistakes."
          "Mistake #1:"
          "Eating risky foods if you are more likely to get food poisoning"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Anyone can get food poisoning. But some people are more likely to get sick and to have a more serious illness. This includes:"
          "•	Adults aged 65 and older"
          "•	Children younger than 5 years"
          "•	People who have health problems or who take medicines that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness (weakened immune systems)"
          "•	Pregnant women"
          "Solution: People who are more likely to get food poisoning should not eat the following:"
          "•	Undercooked or raw animal products (such as meat, chicken, turkey, eggs, or seafood)"
          "•	Raw or lightly cooked sprouts"
          "•	Unpasteurized (raw) milk and juices"
          "•	Soft cheese (such as queso fresco), unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk"
          "Mistake #2:"
          "Not washing your hands"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Germs on your hands can get on food and make it unsafe."
          "Solution: Wash hands the right way—for 20 seconds with soap and running water. Wash hands before, during, and after preparing food; before eating; and after using the toilet or changing a child’s diaper."
          "Mistake #3: "
          "Washing meat, chicken, or turkey"
          "Why It’s a Mistake:"
          " Washing raw meat, chicken, turkey, or eggs can spread germs to your sink, countertops, and other surfaces in your kitchen. Those germs can get on other foods, like salads or fruit, and make you sick."
          "Solution: Don’t wash meat, chicken, turkey, or eggs. Cooking them thoroughly will kill harmful germs."
          "Mistake #4: "
          "Peeling fruits and vegetables without washing them first"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Fruits and vegetables may have germs on their peeling or skin. It’s easy to transfer those germs to the inside of fruits and vegetables when you cut or peel them."
          "Solution: Wash all fruits and vegetables under running water even if you’re going to peel them. Use a clean vegetable brush to scrub firm fruits and vegetables like melons, avocados, and cucumbers."
          "Mistake #5: "
          "Putting cooked meat back on a plate that held raw meat"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Germs from the raw meat can spread to the cooked meat."
          "Solution: Always use separate plates for raw meat and cooked meat. The same rule applies to chicken, turkey, and seafood."
          "Mistake #6: "
          "Not cooking meat, chicken, turkey, seafood, or eggs thoroughly"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Cooked food is safe only after it’s been cooked to a high enough temperature to kill germs."
          "Solution: Use a food thermometer to make sure you cook food to a safe internal temperature."
          "•	145°F for whole cuts of beef, pork, veal, and lamb (then allow the meat to rest for 3 minutes before carving or eating)"
          "•	160°F for ground meats, such as beef and pork"
          "•	165°F for all poultry, including ground chicken and turkey"
          "•	165°F for leftovers and casseroles"
          "•	145°F for fresh ham (raw)"
          "•	145°F for seafood, or cook until flesh is opaque"
          "Mistake #7: Eating raw batter or dough, including cookie dough, and other foods with uncooked eggs or uncooked flour"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Flour and uncooked eggs may contain Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, or other harmful bacteria."
          "Solution: Cook or bake flour and eggs thoroughly. Don’t eat foods that contain raw or undercooked eggs, such as runny eggs, or homemade mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, and eggnog. Don’t eat raw (uncooked) dough or batter that contains either flour or eggs. Keep raw dough away from children, including play dough. Wash hands, work surfaces, and utensils thoroughly after contact with flour and raw dough."
          "Mistake #8:"
          "Tasting or smelling food to see if it’s still good"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: You can’t taste, smell, or see the germs that cause food poisoning. Tasting only a tiny amount can make you very sick."
          "Solution: Check the storage times chart to see how long you can store food safely. When the time is up, throw it out."
          "Mistake #9: "
          "Thawing or marinating food on the counter"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Harmful germs can multiply very quickly at room temperature."
          "Solution: Thaw food safely. You can thaw it:"
          "•	In the refrigerator,"
          "•	In cold water, or"
          "•	In the microwave."
          "Always marinate food in the refrigerator no matter what kind of marinade you’re using."
          "Mistake #10: "
          "Leaving food out too long before putting it in the fridge"
          "Why It’s a Mistake: Harmful germs can grow in perishable foods (including meat, chicken, turkey, seafood, eggs, cut fruit, cooked rice, and leftovers) if you leave them out of the refrigerator 2 hours or longer."
          "Solution: Put perishable foods in the refrigerator within 2 hours or within 1 hour if the food is exposed to a temperature over 90˚F (like in a hot car). Divide roasts and large portions of food, such as pots of stew or chili, into smaller containers so they will chill quickly. It’s OK to put warm or hot food into the refrigerator, as long as it’s packaged in small enough amounts that will cool quickly.",

      // iconImage: 'assets/mars.png',
      description:
          "Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy."
          "Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy."
          "If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease."
          "There isn’t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Taking medicine as needed, getting diabetes self-management education and support, and keeping health care appointments can also reduce the impact of diabetes on your life."
          "Types of Diabetes"
          "There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant)."
          "Type 1 Diabetes"
          "Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake) that stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes."
          "Type 2 Diabetes"
          "With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active."
          "Gestational Diabetes"
          "Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or teen, and more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life too."
          "Prediabetes"
          "In the United States, 88 million adults—more than 1 in 3—have prediabetes. What’s more, more than 84% of them don’t know they have it. With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. The good news is if you have prediabetes, a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program can help you take healthy steps to reverse it."
          "If you have any of the following diabetes symptoms, see your doctor about getting your blood sugar tested:"
          "•	Urinate (pee) a lot, often at night"
          "•	Are very thirsty"
          "•	Lose weight without trying"
          "•	Are very hungry"
          "•	Have blurry vision"
          "•	Have numb or tingling hands or feet"
          "•	Feel very tired"
          "•	Have very dry skin"
          "•	Have sores that heal slowly"
          "•	Have more infections than usual"
          "Symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes"
          "People who have type 1 diabetes may also have nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains. Type 1 diabetes symptoms can develop in just a few weeks or months and can be severe. Type 1 diabetes usually starts when you’re a child, teen, or young adult but can happen at any age."
          "Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes"
          "Type 2 diabetes symptoms often develop over several years and can go on for a long time without being noticed (sometimes there aren’t any noticeable symptoms at all). Type 2 diabetes usually starts when you’re an adult, though more and more children, teens, and young adults are developing it. Because symptoms are hard to spot, it’s important to know the risk factors for type 2 diabetes and visit your doctor if you have any of them."
          "Symptoms of Gestational Diabetes"
          "Gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) usually shows up in the middle of the pregnancy and typically doesn’t have any symptoms. If you’re pregnant, you should be tested for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy so you can make changes if needed to protect your health and your baby’s health.",
